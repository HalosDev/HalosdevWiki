# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» First Install

## Step 1 - Put Plugin in Plugin Folder

First thing first. You will need to put the HalosBountyHunter.jar in the plugins folder on your Minecraft server.&#x20;

## Step 2 - Boot up the server.

You will need to start the server once to generate the **license.yml.**

## Step 3 - Join the discord and get your license key.

You will need to join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/PF5wqRz6m7) to verify your product and receive the **license key.**

## Step 4 - Put your key in the plugin.

Next you need to put your license key given to you by Halos Development in the **license.yml.**

## Step 5 - Restart the server.

Restart the server with the license key setup and you should have access to the reset of the plugin and its configs.&#x20;
